 <h2>How LifeSpan+ Works?</h2>

 <p><b> 1) Blood Donor Sign Up </b></p>
<p>
 Everyone is encouraged to sign up as a Blood Donor on LifeSpan+ through our simple Sign Up page. All we need is an email address and a password to make an account. It's that Simple!
</p>
 
<p><b>2) Donation Requests</b></p>

 <p>Whenever one of our register hospitals are in need of blood, a Request will be sent to the appropriate donors profile and email! The donors who live closest and have the right blood group is our first priority!
</p>

<p><b>3) Confirmation</b></p>
<p>

 Donors who have been sent a blood request will be able to respond with a simple click of a button. They can either select COMING!  |or|  SORRY. Requests will be removed when a successful blood donation takes place or after a period of 24 hours.
